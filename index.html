            <p>I build products and tell stories for brands who are intentional about improving the future of Africa. 
            Stories are a way how we connect with on another and with brands. I love to work with brands with a real 
            world impact that is more than just having a strong balance sheet. I'm open to expanding my client base in 
            international markets and seeing what impact we can make together.</p>
